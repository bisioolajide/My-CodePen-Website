      <h1> Kids staying fit the right way and having fun!</h1>
      <p>Without getting overly complicated, the goal for exercise with kids is to keep things LIGHT and FUN. For kids to get moving, and to do so willingly, they have to be enticed with fun activities that make them smile In addition to that, to keep stress low for parents and caretakers, using limited equipment or what's around the house is an ideal way to make movement activities as straightforward as possible.</p>

      <h2>Exercise</h2>

      <h2>Healthy Eating</h2>
      <p>Half of a child's nutrition intake should fall into the category of Carbohydrates between the ages of one-year to their teenage years. That means the bulk of their food should come in the form of healthy whole food sources. Whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and legumes serve as nutrient-dense sources from nature</p>
